### My personal portfolio website
My very own website that truly reflects who I am as a developer! When I was planning the design of my site, I kept thinking to myself "Should I use a static website generator? What framework is the best? Should I use a CSS framework?", and it seemed there were so many choices to pick from. Instead of mulling over the endless combiations I could use, I decided with the foundations of the web: HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.<br/>
